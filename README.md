# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1:
Import numpy as np 
### Step 2: 
Assign in np.array() in rank of matrix
### Step 3: 
Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.
### Step 4: 
Print the value and end the program
## Program:
```
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by: MOHAMED FAREED F
#RegisterNumber: 22001617
import numpy as np
A=np.array([[1,0,3],[-1,2,-2],[2,3,-1]])
result=np.linalg.inv(A)
print(result)
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the rank for the given matrix is successfully solved by  using a python program.
## Result:
Thus the rank of the given matrix is successfully solved.
